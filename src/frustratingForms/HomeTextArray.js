        "<p>A conversation I once had with a friend.</p><p>Brad: Man, job hunting sucks. You know those sites where they make you create an account with a username and password, then enter your resume, then manually type all your experience, past employer, education, and life history? Why do they make you do that? IT'S IN THE RESUME.</p><p>Me: It could be worse.</p><p>Brad: Could it? Could it really?</p><p>Me: It could always be worse.</p><p>Brad: It could only be worse if they make you waste your time taking some nonesense assesment BEFORE you even get to apply.</p><p>Me: What if they give you the assessment WHILE you are applying? The application itself IS the assessment.</p><p>Brad: Dear Lord, don't give them ideas.</p>"
