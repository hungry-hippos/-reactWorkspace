<h1>Welcome to Filter Forms!</h1>

This is the second project I created, and the project that introduced me to ReactJs. I didn't want be a copycat and go for a cliche React To-Do list, so I came up with this instead. It solidified my understanding on CSS, OOP, and introduced a component-centered way of thinking thanks to React. <br/>
The stack used is NodeJs, HTML/CSS/JS, React and the GoogleMaps API. <br/>
This app was centered around component creation and state-variable toggling. I was learning React and wanted to really nail those concepts down. The workings of this app are pretty straightforward. Different components are toggled depending on which section of the app you are on. Animations were painstakingly made using pure CSS and setIntervals.</br>
If you had the tenacity to play through the entire app, I sincerely apologize. You deserve better. This app started as a joke with a friend, and couple hundred lines of code and coffee pots later became what it is now. It was tons of fun to code, and as an impractical app that creates more problems than solutions, it definitely exels.
